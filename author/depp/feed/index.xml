<p>The newest of the Three Great Academies of Kivotos, which values logic and technical skill over all else. Because of it, they stand at the forefront of scientific research and attract many students who desire to study math or science. Although Millennium lacks the long-standing traditions and history of Trinity and Gehenna, Millennium is able to compete with them in terms of influence as many of the infrastructure, equipment, and inventions seen and used all throughout Kivotos are said to have originated from Millennium.</p>



<p>Every year, the school holds a large-scale contest known as the Millennium Prize, where clubs all throughout the school compete with the results of their club activities.</p>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>In the past, a group of researchers came together in an effort to solve seven difficult problems unsolvable by current technology, called the Millennium Problems. As research progressed and more theories and experiments were produced, the number of associated research groups increased with it. Eventually, Millennium as a school was formed by these research groups, and Seminar was placed at its head.</p>



<h2>School Club</h2>



<p>Many school club in Millenium Science School:</p>



<ul>
<li>Seminar (Student Council)</li>



<li>Cleaning&amp;Clearing</li>



<li>Engineering Department (Engineering Club)</li>



<li>Game Development Department</li>



<li>Veritas</li>



<li>Paranormal Affairs Department (Super Phenomenon Task Force)</li>



<li>Gym Training Department (Athletics Training Club)</li>
</ul>
