Eventually, Millennium as a school was formed by these research groups, and Seminar was placed at its head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>School Club<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many school club in Millenium Science School:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Seminar (Student Council)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleaning&amp;Clearing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Engineering Department (Engineering Club)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Game Development Department<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Veritas<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paranormal Affairs Department (Super Phenomenon Task Force)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gym Training Department (Athletics Training Club)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>&#8220;Through all the challenges and impossible, we strive further into the realm of knowledge.
